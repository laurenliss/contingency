# Contingency Playground
a collection of contingency design methods

## Method 1: Inverse Reality
1. Define the objective truths of your problem space.
2. Define the opposite of these objective truths.
3. When you are done, receive the story of your inverse reality.
4. Imagine the inverse reality is also objectively true and valid.

## Method 2: Almost the Worst
1. Define the best opportunities you can see in your problem space.
2. Define the worst ways to address these opportunities.
3. Is there any useful or unexplored perspective in your worst idea?
4. Bonus Activity: Vote on the worst ideas. The second worst idea is awarded a round of applause, because that person made a risk calculation to be very bad but not the worst and this is a rare circumstance were being just above the bottom is the best place to be.

## Method 3: A Talisman / Companion
1. Define 5 opportunities for skills or making in the problem space that you find personally compelling and have a connection to your intrinsic motivation / personal skillset / ego / etc.
2. Embody these skills in some meaningful way: you may choose to write them on a post-it note, make a drawing, write it on a rock you set in front of you: anything that makes it feel tangible and real.
3. If you find yourself spiraling into a nightmare of ambiguity and anxiety, hold on to this talisman as a reminder that you have value to contribute, and the power to make that real. Give yourself permission.

## Method 4: 16 Boxes
1. Make a list of all known problems / issues / risks that either a) already exist or b) might exist.
2. Build a grid that is four boxes wide by four boxes tall.
3. Label the vertical stack of boxes "consequence" and the horizontal stack of boxes "investment" - or, label them using other terms that are meaningful to the current context.
4. Situate each problem within this grid, using the dimensions of "consequence" and "investment" to provide some quantitative measure of impact.
5. Note the items with high consequence and low investment: this may be a meaningful place to make a snowball.

## Method 5: Mad Lib
1. Define the outcomes of successfully navigating the problem space: what do you want people to feel or do? (assessable action + outcome)
2. Define roadblocks that might prevent them from "feeling that" or "doing that," whatever it is.
3. Get a randomized question prompt that is maybe a novel circumstance you have not considered.

## Method 6: Maid vs Mess
1. With a partner, take turns playing the roles of The Maid and The Mess.
2. The Mess will define the problem as they see it.
3. The Maid will suggest ways to clean it up.
4. Pay the Maid for their labor.

## Turtles all the way down (for problems)
1. Define a problem
2. Define a roadblock
3. Draw a turtle on a piece of paper. Label the turtle with your problem and roadblock in the form of a How Might We statement "how might we ensure that this feature can't be used to enable domestic violence"
4. Discuss and decide if ensuring that is reasonably within your control. If it is, make a contingency plan. If it is not, put a new piece of paper on top of your piece of paper and repeat steps 1 - 3, but update the problem space or roadblock to a space that is reasonably in your control.
5. Give up when it feels right. You don't need to see all the depth to start to make change.
6. Peel back the layers of paper if you would like to see the depth of inquiry.

## Turtles all the way down (for you)
1. Define a thing that consistently holds you back, and write it on a piece of paper.
2. Draw a turtle on the piece of paper. Make a speech bubble where your turtle asks "but why?"
3. Sketch note any response, or keep in your mind, it does not matter because this is for you.
4. Add a second speech bubble that asks "so what do you need?"
5. Repeat Step 3.
6. Add a third speech bubble that asks "is this in your control?"
7. If the answer is yes, keep this conversation with your turtle as a manifested reminder that you know what you need, but you need to find it or give yourself permission to see you already have it. If the answer is no, put a new piece of paper on top of your piece of paper and repeat steps 1 - 7 until the answer is yes.

## Drawing Telephone
1. Everyone picks a word or phrase (three words or less), and writes it on a piece of paper. This can be fun (anything!) to serious (a social issue) to abstract (a concept or adjective).
2. The pieces of paper are collected into a bowl.
3. A piece of paper is drawn and read aloud. Each person has 2 minutes to sketch a representation of the selected paper.
4. Compare your drawings. What is the same? What is different? Why?
5. Repeat until you are done or the bowl is empty.


# Collaboration with IAM Team
The cards below were designed by students in the Interactive Arts & Media department at Columbia College Chicago.

1. What does the community you are designing this product for look like after 10 years of the product’s development? (impact)

2. Brainstorm and label the network of the people that surround your user. How does this product impact the people in their network? (their partner, children, friends, other family, coworkers, etc.) Will your user’s family have the ability to use this product at the same time? (connectivity)

3. “When you invent the plane, you invent the plane crash.” Spend 20 minutes brainstorming how this product could create a negative impact. What is your product’s plane crash?

4. Spend 20 minutes brainstorming how this product could create a positive impact.

5. Design with intention. What is the intention of this product? Have each person write down their answer separately and then compare & contrast. Discuss. (teamwork, intent)

6. What does this product look like in 10 years? How has it evolved? (What does it do now? What technology is involved? Who is using it?)

7. Backtracking - Where is your product now? How did it get there? What technology, societal, economic, etc things took place for it to become what it is? (looking at the past)

8. How would an economic downturn impact the use of your product? How does it impact your user’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors?

9. Brainstorm 10 consequences (positive or negative) that could occur with the launch of your product. What led to these situations?

10. Write out the design process for developing this product. Now put “intention” at the beginning of the process and define the intention as a group. Look past the standard explanation of what the product does and consider the intent of how it will impact the community it will exist in. How is this intention implemented in the rest of the design process? Has it been considered at each stage? Have you hastened the development and compromised the intention due to a desire for speed to market?


11. Who is your target audience? Think of the opposite of that, how does it impact those individuals? (Create the “antonym” of your target user, what do they look like?)

12. Visualize, providing as much detail as you can, what a potential future looks like with this product. Everyone at the table creates their own potential future, then share and discuss.

13. Your product has been disposed of, thrown in the trash for good. You have now pulled it out of the trash and need to find a new use for it. How can you repurpose this product?

14. Dissect your product. List out what makes up your product (features, tech, brand, verbiage, etc.) and create new combinations by switching out a piece with something else.

15. Wikipedia game: Pick two topics that could have a wikipedia page, (ex: Nikki Minaj and Pickles), start with one and using the linked pages inside wikipedia try to get to the other topic in the least amount of time. (This is a real thing and is very fun!)

16. Look into the trash or recycling and find a product/object. Determine what its purpose is and forget it. Now make a list of 10 other purposes this object could have.
